است. بدیهی است که در راستای تحقق این هدف، نیاز به دانشی وسیع از زبان است و علاوه بر محققان علوم رایانه، نیاز به دانش زبان شناسان نیز در این حوزه می\\u200cباشد. با <

به دو دسته کلی قابل تقسیم است: کاربردهای نوشتاری و کاربردهای گفتاری.\\nاز کاربردهای نوشتاری آن می\\u200cتوان به استخراج اطلاعاتی خاص از یک متن، ترجمه یک متن به زبانی دیگر یا یافتن مستنداتی خاص در یک پایگاه داده نوشتاری (مثلاً یافتن کتاب\\u200cهای مرتبط به هم در یک کتابخانه) اشاره کرد. نمونه\\u200cهایی از کاربردهای گفتاری پردازش زبان عبارتند از: سیستم\\u200cهای پرسش و پاسخ انسان با رایانه، سرویس\\u200cهای اتوماتیک ارتباط با مشتری از طریق تلفن، سیستم\\u200cهای آموزش به فراگیران یا سیستم\\u200cهای کنترلی توسط صدا. در سالهای اخیر این حوزه تحقیقاتی توجه دانشمندان را به خود جلب کرده\\u200cاست و تحقیقات قابل ملاحظه\\u200cای در این زمینه صورت گرفته\\u200cاست.\\n</>\\n<:></:>\\n<2>< =\".8..8.7.8.1..8.8...86.9.87\"></>< =\"-\" =\"تاریخچه\">تاریخچه</>< =\"-\">< =\"--\">[</><

=\"//%%%%%%_%%%%%%%%%%%%\" =\"هوش مصنوعی\">هوش مصنوعی</>، که به تعامل بین کامپیوتر و زبان\\u200cهای (طبیعی) انسانی می\\u200cپردازد؛ بنا بر این پردازش زبان\\u200cهای طبیعی بر ارتباط انسان و رایانه، متمرکز است. پس چالش اصلی و عمده در این زمینه درک زبان طبیعی و ماشینی کردن فرایند درک و برداشت مفاهیم بیان\\u200cشده با یک < =\"//%%%%%%%%_%%%%%%%%%%\" =\"زبان طبیعی\">زبان طبیعیِ</> انسانی است.\\nبه تعریف دقیق\\u200cتر، پردازش زبان\\u200cهای طبیعی عبارت است از استفاده از < =\"//%%%%%%%%%%%%\" =\"رایانه\">رایانه</> برای پردازش < =\"//%%%%%%%%_%%%%%%%%%%%%\" =\"زبان گفتاری\">زبان گفتاری</> و < =\"//%%%%%%%%_%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\" =\"زبان نوشتاری\">زبان نوشتاری</>. بدین معنی که رایانه\\u200cها را قادر سازیم که گفتار یا نوشتار تولید شده در قالب و ساختار یک زبان طبیعی را تحلیل و درک نموده یا آن را تولید نمایند. در این صورت، با استفاده از آن می\\u200cتوان به ترجمهٔ زبان\\u200cها پرداخت، از < =\"//%%%%%%%%%%_%%%%\" =\"-\" =\"صفحات وب\">صفحات وب</> و < =\"//%%%%%%%%_%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\" =\"-\" =\"بانک اطلاعاتی\">بانک\\u200cهای اطلاعاتیِ</> نوشتاری جهت پاسخ دادن به پرسش\\u200cها استفاده کرد، یا با دستگاه\\u200cها، مثلاً برای مشورت گرفتن به گفت\\u200cوگو پرداخت.< =\"_-\" =\"\">< =\"#_-\">&#;۱&#;</></>\\nاین\\u200cها تنها مثال\\u200cهایی از کاربردهای متنوع پردازش زبان\\u200cهای طبیعی هستند.\\n</><>هدف اصلی در پردازش زبان طبیعی، ایجاد تئوری\\u200cهایی محاسباتی از زبان، با استفاده از الگوریتم\\u200cها و ساختارهای داده\\u200cای موجود در علوم رایانه است. بدیهی است که در راستای تحقق این هدف، نیاز به دانشی وسیع از زبان است و علاوه بر محققان علوم رایانه، نیاز به دانش زبان شناسان نیز در این حوزه می\\u200cباشد. با < =\"//%%%%%%%%%%%%_%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\" =\"پردازش اطلاعات\">پردازش اطلاعات</> زبانی می\\u200cتوان آمار مورد نیاز برای کار با زبان طبیعی را استخراج کرد. کاربردهای پردازش زبان طبیعی به دو دسته کلی قابل تقسیم است: کاربردهای نوشتاری و کاربردهای گفتاری.\\nاز کاربردهای نوشتاری آن می\\u200cتوان به استخراج اطلاعاتی خاص از یک متن، ترجمه یک متن به زبانی دیگر یا یافتن مستنداتی خاص در یک پایگاه داده نوشتاری (مثلاً یافتن کتاب\\u200cهای مرتبط به هم در یک کتابخانه) اشاره کرد. نمونه\\u200cهایی از کاربردهای گفتاری پردازش زبان عبارتند از: سیستم\\u200cهای پرسش و پاسخ انسان با رایانه، سرویس\\u200cهای اتوماتیک ارتباط با مشتری از طریق تلفن، سیستم\\u200cهای آموزش به فراگیران یا سیستم\\u200cهای کنترلی توسط صدا. در سالهای اخیر این حوزه تحقیقاتی توجه دانشمندان را به خود جلب کرده\\u200cاست و تحقیقات قابل ملاحظه\\u200cای در این زمینه صورت گرفته\\u200cاست.\\n</>\\n<:></:>\\n<>< =\"..............\"></>< =\"-\" =\"تاریخچه\">تاریخچه</>< =\"-\">< =\"--\">[</><

از این حوزه را نیز در پی داشتند. پس از اولین تلاش\\u200cها آشکار شد که پیچیدگی زبان بسیار بیشتر از چیزی\\u200cست که پژوهشگران در ابتدا پنداشته\\u200cبودند. بی\\u200cگمان حوزه\\u200cای که پس از آن برای

کامپیوتر و زبانهای طبیعی انسانی میپردازد؛ بنا بر این پردازش زبانهای طبیعی بر ارتباط انسان و رایانه، متمرکز است پس چالش اصلی و عمده در این زمینه درک زبان طبیعی و ماشینی کردن فرایند درک و برداشت مفاهیم بیانشده با یک   زبان طبیعیزبان طبیعیِ انسانی استبه تعریف دقیقتر، پردازش زبانهای طبیعی عبارت است از استفاده از   رایانهرایانه برای پردازش   زبان گفتاریزبان گفتاری و   زبان نوشتاریزبان نوشتاری بدین معنی که رایانهها را قادر سازیم که گفتار یا نوشتار تولید شده در قالب و ساختار یک زبان طبیعی را تحلیل و درک نموده یا آن را تولید نمایند در این صورت، با استفاده از آن میتوان به ترجمهٔ زبانها پرداخت، از    صفحات وبصفحات وب و    بانک اطلاعاتیبانکهای اطلاعاتیِ نوشتاری جهت پاسخ دادن به پرسشها استفاده کرد، یا با دستگاهها، مثلاً برای مشورت گرفتن به گفتوگو پرداخت   ۱اینها تنها مثالهایی از کاربردهای متنوع پردازش زبانهای طبیعی هستندهدف اصلی در پردازش زبان طبیعی، ایجاد تئوریهایی محاسباتی از زبان، با استفاده از الگوریتمها و ساختارهای دادهای موجود در علوم رایانه است بدیهی است که در راستای تحقق این هدف، نیاز به دانشی وسیع از زبان است و علاوه بر محققان علوم رایانه، نیاز به دانش زبان شناسان نیز در این حوزه میباشد با   پردازش اطلاعاتپردازش اطلاعات زبانی میتوان آمار مورد نیاز برای کار با زبان طبیعی را استخراج کرد کاربردهای پردازش زبان طبیعی به دو دسته کلی قابل تقسیم است کاربردهای نوشتاری و کاربردهای گفتاریاز کاربردهای نوشتاری آن میتوان به استخراج اطلاعاتی خاص از یک متن، ترجمه یک متن به زبانی دیگر یا یافتن مستنداتی خاص در یک پایگاه داده نوشتاری مثلاً یافتن کتابهای مرتبط به هم در یک کتابخانه اشاره کرد نمونههایی از کاربردهای گفتاری پردازش زبان عبارتند از سیستمهای پرسش و پاسخ انسان با رایانه، سرویسهای اتوماتیک ارتباط با مشتری از طریق تلفن، سیستمهای آموزش به فراگیران یا سیستمهای کنترلی توسط صدا در سالهای اخیر این حوزه تحقیقاتی توجه دانشمندان را به خود جلب کردهاست و تحقیقات قابل ملاحظهای در این زمینه صورت گرفتهاست   تاریخچهتاریخچه    ویرایش بخش تاریخچهویرایش بهطور کلی تاریخچه پردازش زبان طبیعی از دهه ۱۹۵۰ میلادی شروع میشود در ۱۹۵۰   آلن تورینگآلن تورینگ مقاله معروف خود را دربارهٔ    آزمایش تورینگآزمایش تورینگ که امروزه به عنوان ملاک هوشمندی شناخته میشود، منتشر ساختنخستین تلاشها برای ترجمه توسط   رایانهرایانه ناموفق بودند، بهطوریکه ناامیدی بنگاههای تأمین بودجهٔ پژوهش از این حوزه را نیز در پی داشتند پس از اولین تلاشها آشکار شد که پیچیدگی زبان بسیار بیشتر از چیزیست که پژوهشگران در ابتدا پنداشتهبودند بیگمان حوزهای که پس از آن برای استعانت مورد توجه قرار گرفت   زبانشناسیزبانشناسی بود اما در آن دوران نظریهٔ زبانشناسی وجود نداشت که بتواند کمک شایانی به پردازش زبانها بکند در سال    ۱۹۵۷ میلادی۱۹۵۷ کتاب    ساختارهای نحویساختارهای نحوی اثر    نوام چامسکینوام چامسکی زبانشناس جوان    آمریکاآمریکایی که از آن پس به شناختهشدهترین چهرهٔ   زبانشناسی نظریزبانشناسی نظری تبدیل شد به چاپ رسید   ۲ از آن پس پردازش زبان با حرکتهای تازهای دنبال شد اما هرگز قادر به حل کلی مسئله نشد   محدودیتهامحدودیتها    ویرایش بخش محدودیتهاویرایش پردازش زبانهای طبیعی رهیافت بسیار جذابی برای ارتباط بین انسان و ماشین محسوب میشود و در صورت عملی شدنش بهطور کامل میتواند تحولات شگفتانگیزی را در پی داشتهباشد سیستمهای قدیمی محدودی مانند     صفحه وجود ندارد که با واژههای محدود و مشخصی سر و کار داشتند، بسیار عالی عمل میکردند، بهطوریکه پژوهشگران را به شدت نسبت به این حوزه امیدوار کردهبودند اما در تقابل با چالشهای جدیتر زبانی و پیچیدگیها و ابهامهای زبانها، این امیدها کمرنگ شدندمسئلهٔ پردازش زبانهای طبیعی معمولاً یک مسئلهٔ     محسوب میشود، چرا که محقق شدن آن بهطور کامل مستلزم سطح بالایی از درک جهان خارج و حالات انسان برای ماشین است   موانعاساسیموانع اساسی    ویرایش بخش موانع اساسیویرایش نیاز به درک معانی   رایانهرایانه برای آن که بتواند برداشت درستی از جملهای داشته باشد و اطلاعات نهفته در آن جمله را درک کند، گاهی لازم است که برداشتی از معنای کلمات موجود در جمله داشته باشد و تنها آشنایی با   دستور زباندستور زبان کافی نباشد مثلاً جمله حسن سیب را نخورد برای اینکه کال بود و جملهٔ حسن سیب را نخورد برای اینکه سیر بود ساختار دستوریِ کاملاً یکسانی دارند و تشخیص اینکه کلمات «کال» و «سیر» به «حسن» برمیگردند یا به «سیب»، بدون داشتن اطلاعات قبلی دربارهٔ ماهیت «حسن» و «سیب» ممکن نیستدقیق نبودن دستور زبانها دستورِ هیچ زبانی آنقدر دقیق نیست که با استفاده از قواعد دستوری همیشه بتوان به نقش هریک از اجزای جملههای آن زبان پی برد   پردازشزبانهایطبیعیآمارگراپردازش زبانهای طبیعی آمارگرا    ویرایش بخش پردازش زبانهای طبیعی آمارگراویرایش پردازش زبانهای طبیعی بهشکل آمارگرا عبارت است از استفاده از روشهای تصادفی،   احتمالاتاحتمالاتی و   آمارآماری برای حل مسائلی مانند آنچه در بالا ذکر شد بهویژه از این روشها برای حل مسائلی استفاده میکنند که ناشی از طولانی بودن جملات و زیاد بودن تعداد حالات ممکن برای نقش کلمات هستند این روشها معمولاً مبتنی بر نمونههای متنی و مدلهای    فرایند مارکفمارکف هستند
